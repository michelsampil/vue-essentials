## Vue has two approaches in order to build an app Vue 2 - Option Api and Vue 3 - Composition Api.

## Option API

Problems with bigger apps:

- Code that belongs together logically is split up across multiple options (data, methods, computed)

- Re-using logic across components can be tricky or cumbersome.

-

## Composition API`

Changes

- data(), methods, computed, watch [OPTION-API] => setup() [COMPOSITION-API]

- LifeCircle Methods changes in the composition API

Comparison between both approaches

Option API approach:

{
data() {
return { name: 'Mr. ðŸ¥”' };
},
methods: { beingFried() { ... }}
}

Composition API approach

{
setup() {
const name = ref('Mr. ðŸ¥”');
function beingFried() { ... };
return { name, beingFried}
}
}

Note: data and methods are replaced by
